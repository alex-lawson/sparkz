Sparkz, a player-created mod for Starbound.

Latest release: v1.0, for Starbound Beta v Indignant Koala 11/12/2013

This mod was created to add wiring and logic functionality above and beyond that which is available in the vanilla game, by adding a variety of wire-interactive sensors, logic blocks, and actuators. To access the vanilla logic gates (until they are officially implemented) use my previous mod, Logic 101, available at http://www.nexusmods.com/starbound/mods/46/

Created by metadept. Please email any questions, suggestions or bug reports to cheswick13@hotmail.com.

FEATURES
-New Item: an alternate Wire Tool which is much easier to craft, allowing access to wiring system in the early game
-New Object: Wiring Station, used to craft logic and wiring recipes
-New Object: Small Wall Switch (a toggle switch which also accepts wire input to activate/deactivate)
-New Object: Small Wall Button (a momentary switch)
-New Object: Small Floor Button (a momentary switch)
-New Object: Large Floor Button (a momentary switch)
-New Object: Pressure Plate (a momentary switch which also triggers when players/items/monsters touch it)
-New Object: Alarm (a ceiling fixture which plays sound and animation when it receives a wire signal)
-New Object: Light Sensor (detects two different levels of light)
-New Object: Water Source Pipe (creates water when powered)
-New Object: Poison Source Pipe (creates poison when powered)
-New Object: Lava Source Pipe (creates lava when powered)
-New Object: Drain (drains liquids when powered)

USAGE
Currently, all recipes in this mod are crafted from the Wiring Station. Obtaining the Wiring Station itself without file editing requires the Tabula Rasa mod. If you want to edit into an existing player file without using Tabula Rasa, the item name is "sparkz_wiringstation"

To obtain the Tabula Rasa, simply 'cook' a torch in a campfire. The Tabula Rasa can then be used to craft the Wiring Station as well as a variety of other mod recipes.
