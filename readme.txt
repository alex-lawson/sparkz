Sparkz, a player-created mod for Starbound.

Latest release: v2.0 PRERELEASE, for Starbound Beta v Angry Koala

This mod was created to add wiring and logic functionality above and beyond that which is available in the vanilla game, by adding a variety of wire-interactive sensors, logic blocks, and actuators.

Created by metadept. Please email any questions, suggestions or bug reports to cheswick13@hotmail.com.

FEATURES
-Displays: Linked Display and Small Linked Display can be used to display numeric data from sensors and counters (with more to come)
-Sensors: Light Sensor, Wind Sensor, and Thermometer can either trigger binary objects or send numeric data to displays
-Scanner: Reads information about a nearby entity, which can be sent to a display. Interact to switch between Current HP and Max HP modes (more modes coming)
-Counter: Uses binary signals to increment, decrement, and reset a stored value, which can then be sent to a display
-Traps: Wall-mounted traps that fire bullets, flame, or rockets when powered! (more types coming soon)
-Source Pipes: Used to create water, poison, or lava when powered
-Drain (drains liquids when powered)
-Quick Wall Button: A version of the default Small Wall Button which can be pressed rapidly - useful for incrementing Counters

-Improvements to a few of the vanilla wire objects
